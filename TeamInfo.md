## Project Summary

<p> &emsp; Our project uses the Sao Paulo transportation dataset. This dataset contains information about the bus company, days of operation, and fare details. It also contains real data on the planned bus route, interval of departure, stop times, and more. Our group thought we could use this information to create an application that could help navigate the city. </p>

<p> &emsp; Our goal is to create a website that may help users traverse the Brazilian city. The website will contain information regarding the closest stop to the user, alongside the next available bus. Additionally, the site will allow the user to log in to access other features. For instance, they can save trip ideas or create a new path for themselves. This will allow people to get around the city in a way that’s best for them. We also plan on providing badges when users achieve milestones, such as visiting a certain number of stops or attending different lines. The app also won’t include alternative modes of transportation, such as driving. These latter features encourage users to take the bus instead of other modes of transportation, which could indirectly benefit the environment. Thus, this app is a useful and fun tool for navigating Sao Paulo in a more environmentally friendly way. </p>
